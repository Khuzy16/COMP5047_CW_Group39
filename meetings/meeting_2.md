## 5. Meeting Discussion
- We discovered that in our security and privacy section we use the same encryption algorithm for both data at rest(AES-256) and transmission data(TLS 1.3). So we could maybe develop one dedicated service in our backend that handles the cryptographic functions for each subsystem and share it across our subsystems. 
- We reviewed each others work and rated out of 10 and gave suggestions for improvement for next meeting.
